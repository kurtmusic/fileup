A Summary of Loading Parameters for Hypertrophy Training

Intensity (%1RM): 60-85% (with potentially some lighter and heavier work)
Rep Range: 20-5 repetitions per set (this is reversed to match the intensity range)
Rest between sets: Anywhere from 30-60 seconds to 2-3 minutes depending on exercise and rep range
Total volume per workout: 30-60 repetitions per muscle group (pay attention to overlap)
Frequency: Each muscle group twice per week or once every fifth day under some situations
Exercise selection: Exceedingly variable, interacts with repetition range
Exercises per muscle group: 1-2 per muscle group per workout is generally sufficient
Failure or not: Depends but generally used sparingly for the volume recommendations made here.
